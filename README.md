# Applications of Neuroscience Ideas at Maze Tasks
### Author: Anna Ágnes Molnár
This project is inspired by the article 'A Learning Gap Between Neuroscience and Reinforcement Learning' (Wauthier et al., 2021). The authors of this paper expand the T-maze rodent experiment into an E-maze task and implement it into an Atari-like game environment, where they experiment with state-of-the-art reinforcement learning agents. They conclude that model-free approaches fail at this task and more experiments are neccessary with model-based approaches, particularly with methods based on computational models of the human memory and/or reward system.

I am attempting a more flexible maze environment to separate the measures of the difficulties of this task. In order to control the differences resulting from the different environments, I intend to test modified versions of some of the model-based methods described in the article.

The main goal, however, is to experiment with model-based methods, particularly ones whose mechanisms are rooted in human memory models. I also intend to use more complicated reward systems which is probably key in the effectiveness of biological agents at similar tasks.
