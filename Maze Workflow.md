# Maze Workflow

## Branches:
1. Environment -> has a child class of different reward systems (hyperparameters)
2. Agents
3. Training
4. Interface for hyperparameters -> has a subclass that displays the agent's motion
5. Outline -> contains a temporary workflow plan with ideas and their resources

## Workflow:

I. Creating project framework
1. Simple environment (e.g. T-maze)
2. Simple agent (e.g. random) for testing
3. Simple reward system (e.g. negative rewards)
4. Example interface
5. Training

II. Experimenting, creating new options
6. Adding new agents
7. New reward systems
8. Changing the environment

III. Final comparisons, conclusions
